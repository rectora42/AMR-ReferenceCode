**A. Give the equation of the least-squares regression line. Define any variables you use.**

$Y =$ number of balloons needed to fill a balloon box  

$V =$ is the volume (V) of the box, where $V=(height)^3$ of the box  

$Y = 45.008 + 10.809V$

$Y = 45.008 + 10.809H^3$ 

**B. Suppose the height of a box is 8ft, predict how many balloons are needed to fill the box.**  

$Y = 45.008 + 10.809(8)^3\approx5579.219$ balloons
